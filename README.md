# SI-CART
Post-selection inference for regression trees

## Replicability
1. To replicate the simulations presented in the paper on a small scale, one can refer to the following notebooks under the path `Simulations/Replication`:
   1. Figure 1 & 2: `first_example.ipynb`
   3. Figure 3 & analogous result with Laplace noise: `vary_signal.ipynb`
   4. Figure 4: `vary_p.ipynb`
3. To run the full simulations on e.g. a computing cluster, one can refer to the following scripts under the path `Simulations`:
   1. Figure 1 & 2: `toy_example.py`
   3. Figure 3 & analogous result with Laplace noise: `vary_signal.py`
   4. Figure 4: `vary_p.py`
